    <h1>Beakstar Systems Terms of Service</h1>
    <div>These terms of service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our services, including our websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, commerce services, and our other covered services that link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”). By using our Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display may be able to be viewed by other users of the Services. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</li>
      <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services.</li>
      <li>We may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including the availability of any Services feature, database, or content. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.</li>
      <li>We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Services or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Services, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</li>
